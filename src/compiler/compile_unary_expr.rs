/// Compiles a unary expression into assembly instructions, pushing the results into `instructions`

/// * operand - the operand of the unary expression
/// * location - where to put the result of the expression.

/// NOTE: this function must leave the state of the operand and location correct, or the output may be incorrect.
/// While maintaining it, watch out for:
///   - Do not modify the operand location. The operand must remain the same before and after.
///
///   - DO NOT modify `location` before using `operand`. Flow is "do operation, then put result to location atomically".
///     This is because `operand` and `location` could be the *same*, so if the `location` was modified
///     during the expression, you might modify the operand before you use it.
