/// Compiles a binary expression into assembly instructions, pushing the results into `instructions`
/// * `kind` - the type of binary expression
/// * `operand_1` - the first operand of the binary expression
/// * `operand_2` - the first operand of the binary expression
/// * `location` - where to put the result of the expression.
///
/// NOTE: this function must leave the state of the operands and location correct, or the output may be incorrect.
/// While maintaining it, watch out for:
///   - Do not modify the operand locations. The operands must remain the same before and after.
///
///   - DO NOT modify `location` within the operation. Flow is "do operation, then put result to location atomically".
///     This is because `operand_1` or `operand_2` or `location` could be the *same*, so if the `location` was modified
///     during the expression, you might modify one of the operands before you use it.
