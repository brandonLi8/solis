//! Performs variable conflict analysis. Conflict analysis calculates a graph (called the `InterferenceGraph`) where
//! each variable is a node and edges represents conflicts, which is when two variables cannot be assigned the same
//! register.
//!
//! In other words, a conflict (an edge) is when both variable's lifetimes intersect at some point, meaning they cannot
//! be assigned the same register. This is the approach that is used to create the interference graph: by performing
//! liveness analysis (see `liveness_analysis.rs`) on each expression in a block (in reverse order), and for the
//! variables that are returned in the liveness set are added to the graph as a strongly connected component.
