//! Generally speaking, register allocation is a compiler optimization that attempts to utilize as many registers as
//! possible for sub-expressions and variables before resorting to utilizing the stack.
//!
//! Part of the problem has been solved by translating the input program into the Intermediate Representation, which
//! flattens sub-expressions into temporary variables (see `ir.rs`). This is more conducive to the register allocation,
//! which is now reduced to allocating for variables only.
//!
//! The allocator works by analyzing each block of the IR and creating an assignment of each variable into either a
//! register or the stack (the location within the stack is handled in the symbol table at the compiler step). We use
//! Chaitin's algorithm to create a correct and reasonable assignment. On a high level, the algorithm works by creating
//! a graph where each variable is a node and each edge represents a conflict between the variables. A conflict
//! is when both variable's lifetimes intersect at some point, meaning they cannot be assigned the same register. Then,
//! we k-color the graph to achieve an assignment where neighboring edges have different assignments.
